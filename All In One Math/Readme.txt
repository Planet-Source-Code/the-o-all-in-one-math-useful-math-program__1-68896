This program is called All In One Math.  I made it a while ago when school was still in 
so that it could help me with algebra 2 honors homework.  It has a lot of tools that help
you solve math problems such as quadratic equations and system of equations.
It also has a calculator that used to be my Talking Calculator with Merlin.  I took out 
Merlin and added a few more functions.  It also has a graph that will plot a line that 
you put in and it will tell you the slope, the distance between the two points and the 
midpoint of the line segment. 

If you wanna make any changes and make it better please do so but please email
me if you are and email me the changes you've made.  I'm interested in learning.
