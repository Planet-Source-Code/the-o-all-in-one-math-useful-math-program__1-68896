### Description

This program is called All In One Math. I made it a while ago when school was still in

so that it could help me with algebra 2 honors homework. It has a lot of tools that help

you solve math problems such as quadratic equations and system of equations.

It also has a calculator that used to be my Talking Calculator with Merlin. I took out

Merlin and added a few more functions. It also has a graph that will plot a line that

you put in and it will tell you the slope, the distance between the two points and the

midpoint of the line segment.
